BahnTS2 Project
=============

This repository contains a clone of the [TS2 server](https://github.com/ts2/ts2-sim-server), [TS2 client](https://github.com/ts2/ts2), and [BahnDSL](https://gitlab.rz.uni-bamberg.de/swt/teaching/2019-ws/thesis-masters-bahndsl) projects.
More details can be found in the Readme files of each project. 

This repository has also been configured to automatically build and run tests whenever 
a push has been performed.  See the CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous
deployment) area in GitLab. If a pipeline failure is reported, make sure that **only one** 
pipeline instance is running, otherwise the tests might not be run correctly.
